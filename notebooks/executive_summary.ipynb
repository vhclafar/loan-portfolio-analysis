    "**Portfolio Quality Assessment**\n",
    "\n",
    "The portfolio consists of 2 176 loans with a total exposure of approximately € 37.2 million.\n",
    "The overall default rate is 20.3 %, which is substantially higher than typical auto-leasing benchmarks (3–8 %), indicating a weak credit profile and potential deficiencies in screening or pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key risk drivers**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Factor\tObservation\tInterpretation**\n",
    "\n",
    "\tLoan-to-Value (LTV)\tDefaults rise from 16.7 % for LTV ≤ 80 % to 25.6 % for 80–100 %.\n",
    "\tHigher leverage strongly correlates with default — borrowers financing most of the vehicle value are riskier.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tLoan Term\tDefaults increase from 13.1 % (≤ 36 months) to 22.2 % (37–60 months).\tLonger tenors cause payment fatigue; shorter loans perform better.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tVehicle Age\tLoans on older cars (9–15 y) show 13.6 % defaults.\tVehicle age has limited impact; LTV and term dominate risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tAffordability (Income Ratio)\tClients with low expense-to-income ratio (≤ 0.3) default only 6.3 %.\tConfirms affordability pressure drives risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tApplication Source\tDefaults surge to 42.9 % (web) and 35.6 % (system) vs 18 % (dealer).\tDirect or online originations are substantially riskier — weak KYC or scoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tWarrantor Presence\tWith warrantor: 9.2 % default vs without: 20.8 %.\tGuarantees sharply reduce default risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tDealer / Region\tDealers #54 (29 %) and #40 (28 %) and Regions #15 (22 %) & #8 (20 %) underperform.\n",
    "\tConcentrated operational or underwriting issues in specific partners.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tVehicle Make\tPremium brands (Mercedes ≈ 25 %, Audi ≈ 23 %) underperform mainstream (Opel ≈ 14 %).\tPossible over-financing or residual-value sensitivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tVintage trend:\n",
    "\tDefault rates for newer vintages show a mild upward drift, suggesting that loans originated after early 2024 perform worse, possibly due to relaxed underwriting or macro stress.\n",

    "\t3.\tRestrict online and system originations until stronger verification and scoring in place.\n",
    "\t4.\tEncourage warrantor usage or co-signers; those loans default less than half as often.\n",
